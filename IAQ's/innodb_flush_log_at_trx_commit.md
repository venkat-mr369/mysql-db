---

## 📝 What is it?

This setting controls **how MySQL writes and saves transaction logs** (InnoDB redo logs) to disk.
It directly affects **data safety** and **performance**.

---

## ⚙️ Possible Values

`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` can be **0, 1, or 2**.

### 1️⃣ Value = 1 (Default)

* **Every transaction commit → log is written to disk immediately.**
* Safest (no data loss if MySQL crashes).
* Slower (because disk I/O happens on every commit).

👉 Example:
Imagine a shopkeeper writing **every sale immediately into a notebook and then locking it in a safe**.
Even if the shop burns down, no sales are lost.

---

### 2️⃣ Value = 2

* **Log is written to OS memory (not directly to disk) at commit.**
* OS writes it to disk every second.
* Faster than `1`, but if the **server crashes** (OS crash/power failure), you may lose **1 second of data**.

👉 Example:
The shopkeeper **writes the sale in a notebook but leaves it on the counter**.
If the shop burns down before he locks it in the safe, he may lose up to 1 second of sales.

---

### 3️⃣ Value = 0

* **Log is written and flushed to disk only once per second, not at every commit.**
* Fastest, but you may lose up to **1 second of transactions** if MySQL crashes.
* Good only for systems where **performance is more important than data safety**.

👉 Example:
The shopkeeper **writes all sales on a chalkboard** and only **once a minute copies them into the notebook and locks it in the safe**.
If the shop burns down, he loses up to 1 second of sales.

## 🔍 Quick Comparison

| Value | Performance | Data Safety | Risk of Data Loss              |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **1** | Slowest     | Safest      | No loss (even if crash)        |
| **2** | Medium      | Medium      | Lose up to 1 sec (OS crash)    |
| **0** | Fastest     | Lowest      | Lose up to 1 sec (MySQL crash) |

## 🚀 Example in MySQL

```sql
-- Check current setting
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit';

-- Change setting to 2 for faster commits (less safe)
SET GLOBAL innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2;
```

---

✅ **Rule of Thumb**:

* **Banking / Financial apps** → Use `1` (safest).
* **Reporting / Analytics apps** → Can use `2`.
* **Very high-speed apps where some loss is okay** → Can use `0`.
